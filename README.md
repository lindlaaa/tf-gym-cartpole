Tried to create a custom FC NN with PyTorch, but got overwhelmed and resorted to using SentDexs' example to at least get it working.

After looiing for examples of good PyTorch usage I am thinking it might be best to start looking directly into Tensorflow...
Also looking into more professional education materials, or more thurough materials.
